# Marine_Miracles_Simulation
Repository containing all the files for the marine ecosystem simulation. This includes both the Unity project files as well as the built (i.e. exported and usable on Windows PCs without Unity) program.

P.S. Mr. Seidel, if you want to find the code that we made, go to OceanSimulation / Assets / Scripts. That file includes all the code we wrote for the program. The other files contain assets, scripts, and libraries that we downloaded for this project.
